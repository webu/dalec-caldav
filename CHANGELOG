# 0.2.0

* Add `DALEC_CALDAV_SERCH_EVENT_START_TIMEDELTA` and `DALEC_CALDAV_SERCH_EVENT_END_TIMEDELTA` 
  settings. Default values are respectively -1 day and +365 days.  
  It could be a breaking change if the real behaviour you expected was to only keep only the X 
  oldest events. (`X` depending the settings). If you want to continue to fetch all events, you
  can set those settings to `None`.
* Improve tests with ICS files containing different test cases
* Add the hability to test with other external caldav servers to be sure that this Dalec will work 
  with your specific caldav server.

# 0.1.0

* First official release \o/
